# Setting Up and Deploying 

## Requirements
Before you can set up and deploy the Next.js application, you will need to have the following software and accounts:

- Node.js (version 18.16 or later)
- `yarn` package manager
- A Vercel account (you can sign up for free at https://vercel.com/)

## Step 1: Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository for the Next.js application you want to deploy:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/askariali/dan-abramov-blog.git

cd dan-abramov-blog
```

## Step 2: Install Dependencies
Next, install the required dependencies for the application:

```bash
yarn install
```

## Step 3: Test the Application Locally
Before deploying the application, test it locally to make sure everything is working as expected:

```bash
yarn run dev
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

## Step 4: Deploy the Application to Vercel
Once you've tested the application locally, you're ready to deploy it to Vercel:

1. Log in to the Vercel Dashboard at https://vercel.com/dashboard.
2. Click the "Import Project" button in the top-right corner of the screen.
3. Follow the prompts to import the application from your local repository.
4. Once the import is complete, you can configure the deployment options for the application. You can choose to use the default options or customize them as needed.
5. Click the "Deploy" button to deploy the application.
6. Once the deployment is complete, Vercel will provide you with a URL where you can access the application.

## Conclusion
That's it! You've now set up and deployed a Next.js version 13 application to Vercel. If you have any issues or questions, feel free to refer to the documentation or reach out to the support team.
